            <h2>We are changing millions of lives through technology and Charity.</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2019, Nairocare is a social enterprise that applies technology and innovative tools to raise
                funds and resources for Internally Displaced Persons(IDPs) in Nigeria. A pioneer in the field of social
                advocacy married with the use of financial technology tools. Nairocare uses an array of technology tools
                to simplify fundraising and crowdfunding for the Internally Displaced Persons(IDP) across Nigeria. We
                are in constant partnership with civil societies, NGOs, CSOs, public institutions and the media, chiefly
                in the areas of advocacy, community engagement, research, innovation, and technology. Nairocare's
                methodology is deploying refined skill sets to creatively develop tools and platforms to strategically
                crowdfund and raise funds for the education, shelter, health, and well-being of every Internally

                living in IDP camps and help accelerate their re-integration back into society. Our mission was born out
                of the burning desire to solve the biggest problems in the Nigerian society. We intend to leverage the
                use of technology and humanitarian efforts to alleviate the pain and suffering of internally displaced
                persons.

                        We, at NairoCare realize most people have a problem donating to charity organizations because
                        they believe the funds are not properly allocated.
                        That is why we go the extra mile to be as transparent as possible. Our ledger is available on
                        our website for anyone to access.<br>
                        Our ledger shows; how much we receive, how much we spend, what we spend on and how much we have
                        left.
